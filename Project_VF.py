#ABSTRACT PART

    st.markdown('<div style="text-align: justify"> Decentralized Finance system grew of 250% in a year and represents a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $235B as of April 6th, 2022, according to analytics firm Defillama. At the intersection between finance and blockchain technology, it offers its community the opportunity to access financial services free of intermediary. That freedom is a benefit for many populations underbanked or totally excluded from the exclusive centralized traditional financial systems as well as for investors looking for more independence. This new decentralized system is still free willing and largely unregulated which offers several opportunities but also uncountable risks. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the parameters influencing Decentralized Finance (DeFi)’s growth to forecast its future value. This analytical research paper creates a simple regression model to predict Defi’s performance. For this, we would lay the foundation of DeFi(I) by analyzing the underlying technologies structuring the ecosystem, defining the principles of DeFi and comparing DeFi to the traditional financial system. We would also observe Defi performance from 2019 to April 2020 and construct a multilinear regression model to understand how inflation, Bitcoin value, gas fees prices and cybersecurity exploits impact DeFi’s TVL performance (II). Finally, we would submit a study of futures events and systems such as Cyber Security Breach, Cryptocurrency Regulations, Environmental Social Governance (ESG), Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) that could redefine the path to expect for DeFi’s Future Performance (III).  </div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)

#INTRO PART
    st.title("INTRO")
    st.markdown('<div style="text-align: justify"> Decentralized Finance has become vernacular, and its name is often mingled with other new age denominations such as Digital Asset, Web3, Disintermediation or even Blockchain, but many don’t have a clear idea of its meaning or what its promise really encompasses. Fundamentally, DeFi provides financial services. Although, those are categorized as “Decentralized” because no traditional financial system is used to provide these decentralized financial services. Instead, DeFi uses the Blockchain Technology to achieve that purpose and offering a service deemed as trustful. Financial Services are now accessible everywhere with an internet connection. Consequently, the term “decentralized” is used to differentiate DeFi with the traditional finance that operates with a centralized protocol (system of large financial intermediaries) to interact between supply and demand on the market. That shift of financial system methods and processes is important since for the first time, the party trusted to monitor the money’s custody changes. As you might understand DeFi is a utility born out of many applications offering different types of financial services totally independent from a middleman. Users can utilize those applications called Decentralized application (Dapps) to use Decentralized financial services. It is this whole ecosystem of application that we qualify as “DeFi”.</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)

Indeed, DeFi is a group of Decentralized Applications created by different engineers to provide financial services to users and those Dapps are built on top of Blockchains (B.Hor and al.2021).

Dapps can interact with several blockchains at same the time but blockchains interacting together is still an issue being solved essentially with cross-chain and multi-chain infrastructures. On a multi-chain effort, some blockchains are Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, making it very easy for them to spin up a version of existing Dapps. This include Fantom, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche networks. Being EVM compatible is major since Ethereum is the most used blockchain on the DeFi ecosystem, thus it attracts a substantial number of users. For the non EVM compatible blockchains, bridges platforms can connect some blockchains together and create that path needed for scalability. Cross-chain infrastructures are platforms like bridges that don’t offer DeFi services but help the different blockchains to be interconnected together to let the liquidity in DeFi transit between blockchain networks. Moreover, Ethereum blockchain currently uses a Proof-of-work (POW) consensus that leads to scalability issues (high demands on the chain slower transactions process) and creates nonviable gas prices. The network is concurrently saving that issue by creating cross connections. They work on scaling to second layers (layer 2), which offer the same security to the users, without the congestion of the layer 1 blockchain and on upgrading from POW consensus to Proof-of-Stake (POS) to limit the lack of scalability and high gas fee prices. These cases help tremendously the DeFi sector to provide services to more users and scale efficiently even if many of those projects are currently on beta production.</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)

#PART I - B : DeFi Principles

    st.markdown('<div style="text-align: justify"> Accessibility encompasses the horizontal and vertical aspect of accessibility. The horizontal aspect of Accessibility is Inclusivity. DeFi aims to allow everybody to use DeFi platforms no matter their identity or their localization in the world. To this end, price to access the platforms are lower enough to avoid discrimination of entry and Know Your Customer (KYC) process is removed to keep privacy of identity. The downside from that principle is that it could lead to Anti Money Laundering (AML) issues and other financial frauds.\n\n'
                'Nevertheless, this presents a structural limit comparatively to traditional Finance. (C. Crenshaw, 2021) The system doesn’t offer any efficient method for determining the actual identity of users. Since the market is not regulated and the identity of user is anonymous, it is difficult to know if the price of assets and the trading volume reflect organic interest or if it is the result of trading manipulation from investors: users or group of users trading collusively can have many public addresses and IP addresses to manipulate, trades, and creates bots to their advantage.\n\n '
                'The vertical aspect of accessibility is the Scalability. Scalability of DeFi platform is the capacity to keep effectiveness and security while providing a service of quality to an exponential population of users at the same time. For instance, if several people from all over the world use a Decentralized Application simultaneously, will the Dapp be able to process the transactions as fast as before and with no error neither breach of security? This matter is still being worked on and would be greatly analyzed in the potential risks section.</div>\n\n', unsafe_allow_html=True)

This system of shares by computer annihilates the need for an intermediary such as how it is in traditional finance, leading to disintermediation.

The value lost to hacks and exploits crossed the billion-dollar in late 2021, making it clear that meaningful security remains a challenge for the industry. The proliferation of hasty forks, unaudited deployments, and outright scams led to hundreds of millions of dollars of unnecessary losses. '
